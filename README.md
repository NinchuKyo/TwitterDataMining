Twitter Data Mining Project
---
A series of python scripts used in order to determine what association rules we could find between a user's hashtags and anything we could conclude from that.

Scripts included were used to pre-process the raw data, select which data to use, transform the data for it to be
compatible with Orange (Python data mining library), and running Apriori on the data.
